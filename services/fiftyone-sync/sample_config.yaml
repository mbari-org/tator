# Sample FiftyOne dataset config for Tator sync.
# Use with POST /sync?config_path=... or pass path when calling sync_project_to_fiftyone.
#
# After sync, crops are saved to /tmp/fiftyone_sync_project_{id}/crops/{media_stem}/{elemental_id}.png
# and this config is applied when building the FiftyOne dataset.

dataset_name: tator_project_dataset
# Optional: only include samples with these labels (from attributes.Label)
# include_classes:
#   - Larvacean
#   - Copepod

# Image extensions to scan (crops are .png)
image_extensions:
  - "*.png"
  - "*.jpg"
  - "*.jpeg"
  - "*.bmp"
  - "*.tiff"

# Optional: limit samples for testing
# max_samples: 500

# Optional: compute embeddings (from embed service) and UMAP after sync
# Embeddings come from http://localhost:8000/embeddings/{project}/ where project = Tator project name (get_project(project_id).name).
# UMAP requires umap-learn. Set FASTVSS_API_URL to override the embed service base URL.
